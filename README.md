### Interview-Questions

This Notebook was developed with the intention to provide possible solutions for common interview questions.

Those questions are real questions asked by Tech companies, Financial institutions and Software corporations.

The main purpose is for the author to practice and do not let his coding skills get rusty.

However, I hope this may be helpful to you in some way.
